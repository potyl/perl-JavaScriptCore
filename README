JavaScriptCore
============

This module provides the Perl bindings for the JavaScript engine of WebKit.

WebKit is a web content engine, derived from KHTML and KJS from KDE, and used
primarily in Apple's Safari browser and Google's Chrome browser. It is made to
be embedded in other applications, such as mail readers, or web browsers.

It is able to display content such as HTML, SVG, XML, and others. It also
supports DOM, XMLHttpRequest, XSLT, CSS, Javascript/ECMAscript and more.
